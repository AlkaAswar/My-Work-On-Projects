# Projects
### Project 1 Netflix Analysis
In this Project I collected the data from Kaggle and then perform some EDA part for the analysis, In the Analysis EDA and Visualization is done

### Project 2 Telecommunication Churn Customer Prediction
In this project we perform different algorithms and see the accuracy of each and observed
which features is highly affected on churn customer

### Project 3 Customer Segmentation Analysis
In this project we predict the output in 4 cluster and see that which type of customer it is
and what we have to improve like to give more offers and and what customer wants .

### Project 4 Predict CTR of an Email Campaign (Participated in Hackathon)
Using the given data we have to predict that the Click rate percentage and how we can improve for more click rate .
which containt we should add and in Email so that customer will click on that mail that we have to predict

### project 5 Air Quality forecasting(CO2 emissions) 

Business Objective:
To forecast Co2 levels for an organization so that the organization can follow government norms with respect to Co2 emission levels.

Data Set Details:
Time parameter and levels of Co2 emission

Acceptance criteria:
1.	Detailed EDA (Visualization, missing value handling, outlier detection, skewness removal etc.)
2.	Find the variables which are co related and consider building in your model and other feature engineering stuff if you can.
3.	Pay attention to splitting of data.
4.	Use your own understanding for identifying the algorithms that you need to use. However since it's mostly a forecasting problem use models associated with it.
5.	Once model is finalized train it using whole data available
6.	Use plot libraries to output the finding in each state
7.	You can use Jupyter or any other notebook for the same or develop with desktop IDEs like Visual Studio
8.	The project should be in working condition which is the most important thing even if we donâ€™t use all the considerations as described above. Deploy it using any technique suitable.
